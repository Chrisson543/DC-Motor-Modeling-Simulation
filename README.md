# DC-Motor-Modeling-Simulation
This project focuses on modeling and simulating a brushed DC motor using MATLAB and Simulink. A Maxon DCX 22 L motor was selected, and its catalog data was used to derive electrical and mechanical parameters such as resistance, inductance, inertia, torque constant, and back EMF constant.
